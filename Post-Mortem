My 5th project? First 5 definitely.

This was actually almost fun to play but suffered from the same development
issues as the first game which were

- Really implusive coding. ( Very little looks like I actually put thought into it )
- Overusage of inheritance ( I still do this because I've not used Entity-Component Systems yet, but I should seriously consider it )
- Again little usage of data driven programming which would've been very useful.
- Lack of content ( I spent too much time programming the basics )
- Speaking of too much time on the basics, I spent too much time adding unnecessary things to the "framework" as I intended to originally reuse it.
- The problem with the framework is that it's not flexible and features were mainly added because of the game
- Speaking of which I didn't listen to the "develop game not engine" mentality ( which there is a pretty fine line towards. )
- Also lack of art and stuff like that didn't help.

In general this needs a lot of work, but at least it actually runs on my PC properly unlike the first one which I broke accidently
and haven't reverted any commits cause I was lazy :P
